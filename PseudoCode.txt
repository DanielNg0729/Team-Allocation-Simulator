Team Formation Algorithm - Pseudocode
High-Level Overview
PROGRAM TeamFormation:
    1. Read student data from CSV file
    2. Organize students by tutorial groups
    3. For each tutorial group:
        - Form balanced teams using greedy algorithm
    4. Output teams to CSV file
    5. Analyze and visualize diversity metrics
END PROGRAM
Detailed Pseudocode
Main Process
FUNCTION main():
    data = READ_CSV("records.csv")
    students_by_group = ORGANIZE_BY_GROUP(data)
    
    all_teams = []
    FOR EACH group IN students_by_group:
        teams = FORM_TEAMS(group, team_size)
        ADD teams TO all_teams
    
    WRITE_TO_CSV(all_teams)
    VISUALIZE_DIVERSITY(all_teams)
END FUNCTION
Team Formation (Greedy Algorithm)
FUNCTION form_teams(students, team_size):
    teams = []
    available = students
    
    WHILE available has enough students:
        current_team = []
        
        WHILE current_team.size < team_size:
            best_student = NULL
            best_score = -infinity
            
            FOR EACH student IN available:
                test_team = current_team + student
                score = CALCULATE_SCORE(test_team)
                
                IF score > best_score:
                    best_score = score
                    best_student = student
            
            ADD best_student TO current_team
            REMOVE best_student FROM available
        
        ADD current_team TO teams
    
    DISTRIBUTE remaining students TO existing teams
    
    RETURN teams
END FUNCTION
Scoring System
FUNCTION calculate_score(team):
    school_score = SCORE_SCHOOL_DIVERSITY(team)
    gender_score = SCORE_GENDER_DIVERSITY(team)
    cgpa_score = SCORE_CGPA_BALANCE(team)
    
    total = school_score + gender_score + cgpa_score
    RETURN total
END FUNCTION

RULES:
- School Diversity: 
    * All different = 100 points
    * Max 2 from same school = 50 points
    * Otherwise = 0 points

- Gender Diversity:
    * 2-3 of same gender = 100 points
    * 1 or 4 of same gender = 50 points
    * Otherwise = 0 points

- CGPA Balance:
    * Team average within 0.15 of class average = 100 points
    * Within 0.30 = 50 points
    * Within 0.50 = 20 points
    * Otherwise = 0 points
